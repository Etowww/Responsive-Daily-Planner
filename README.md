# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
This is a responsive work day scheduler application that displays the current date and the top of the screen as well as time blocks from 9am-5pm that have text fields for the user to enter and save any useful information as a reminder. The time blocks are color coordinated to show wether that time block is in the past, present, or future.
The time blocks also contain a save button that allows the user to save their text input for a specific hour to local storage allowing the text to remain displayed even if the page is refreshed. This application was built to help the user better manage things-to-do or events they have planned for any given work day.

## Features
Ability to save any text that is input into timeblock by pressing the blue save button.

## How to Contribute
The application could use a clear text input button so the user does not have to manually clear the text input and resave it.

The application could probably be improved by changing how the timeblock takes and displays data. For example what if you would like to add more then one event to any given timeblock. Potentially fix this by manipulating the dom to create and append new events to a single time block.
